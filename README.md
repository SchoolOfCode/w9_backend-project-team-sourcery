# Sourcery

Sourcery is a centralized platform for posting and viewing resources that could be of use to School of Code bootcampers.

Users can post links to resources they deem useful by entering their name, the URL of the resource and a brief description of how the resource may be helpful into the dedicated input fields at the top of the page. 

Users can also view resources previously posted by themself or other users, and are even able to add a like to the post to show their appreciation.

There are also links across the navigation bar which lead to well known commonly used resources.
